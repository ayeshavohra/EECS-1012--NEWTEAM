# Name of Game - Red & Blue

Description

This game is a new unique variation of tic tac toe. There will be 2 players that will play against one other. Each player will be appointed a red circle or a blue circle. Player 1 will be red, and Player 2 will be blue. The game will either be played between 2 individuals (player vs player) or between an individual vs computer (player vs computer). Once the game begins a box will appear, for one or both players to write their names. A dice will then be rolled to depict which player will start. The winning player will be the player that is first to create a row – horizonal, vertical, diagonal in the colour given (red or blue). There will be a chance to re-play the game at the end and the game will identify the winner upon finishing. We hope this project will give us a better taste on building software.
